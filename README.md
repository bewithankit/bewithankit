### <font face="Arial">About Me</font>

- 🔭 I'm interested in Climate Change, Aerosols, HPC, and more!
- 🎓 Currently a **Doctoral Student** at the University of Reading.
- 🚀 Working on accelerating the computation of air quality projections over India using novel computing.

### <font face="Arial">Previous Experience</font>

Previously, I worked with the [Computational and Modelling Services unit of the National Centre for Atmospheric Science (NCAS-CMS)](https://cms.ncas.ac.uk/) where I contributed to the library code and helped develop recipes for analysing simulations using [cf-python](https://ncas-cms.github.io/cf-python) and [cf-plot](https://ajheaps.github.io/cf-plot) data analysis software libraries.
