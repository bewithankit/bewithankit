- Hi, I’m Ankit Bhandekar!
- I’m interested in Climate Change, Aerosols, HPC, etc.
- I'm currently a Doctoral Student at the University of Reading working on accelerating the computation of air quality projections over India using novel computing. Previously I worked with the [Computational and Modelling Services unit of the National Centre for Atmospheric Science (NCAS-CMS)](https://cms.ncas.ac.uk/) helping to publicise and develop recipes for analysing simulations using the [cf-python](https://ncas-cms.github.io/cf-python) and [cf-plot](https://ajheaps.github.io/cf-plot) data analysis software libraries.
