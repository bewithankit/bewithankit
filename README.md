- 👋 Hi, I’m Ankit Bhandekar!
- 👀 I’m interested in Climate Change, Aerosols, Indian Monsoon, etc.
- 🌱 I currently work with the [Computational and Modelling Services unit of the National Centre for Atmospheric Science (NCAS-CMS)](https://cms.ncas.ac.uk/) helping to publicise and develop recipes for analysing simulations using the [cf-python](https://ncas-cms.github.io/cf-python) and [cf-plot](https://ajheaps.github.io/cf-plot) data analysis software libraries. 
- 📫 You can reach me at [:incoming_envelope:](mailto:ankit.bhandekar@ncas.ac.uk)
